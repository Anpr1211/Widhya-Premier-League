The first 6 overs of a T20 game are the powerplay overs, which are generally bowled by seamers. Due to this fact, he has been dismissed by seamers most of the times. The two main seamers of KXIP this year, Md. Shami and Sheldon Cotrell have dismissed Quinton one each, the former in a previous season and the latter in this very season of IPL. Thus, owing to the position that he plays in, he can be expected to be dismissed by a seamer."
